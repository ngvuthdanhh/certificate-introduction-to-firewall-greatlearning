# NAT and Firewalls

## What is NAT?
- Network Address Translation maps private IP addresses to public IPs.
- Hides internal network structure.

## Types
- Static NAT: one-to-one mapping
- Dynamic NAT: many-to-many mapping
- PAT (Port Address Translation): many-to-one mapping

## Benefits
- Adds security by obscuring internal IPs
- Enables multiple devices to share single public IP
