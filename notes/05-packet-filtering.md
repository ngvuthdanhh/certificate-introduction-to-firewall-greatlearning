# Packet Filtering and Stateful Inspection

## Packet Filtering
- Examines each packet individually.
- Decisions based on IP, port, protocol.
- Fast, but cannot track connections.

## Stateful Inspection
- Tracks connection states (e.g., TCP handshake).
- Blocks unexpected packets.
- More secure than simple packet filtering.
